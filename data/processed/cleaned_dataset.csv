This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

d6o2o5x,"> take with me to occupy my time on the train or planes.

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.  The Momentums are really laid back up top, the the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.

d6ofntp,"The M50x does have good noise isolation, but isolation doesn't help that well with low notes like an engine hum. Noise cancellation is different and does well with these low notes since they're predictable. I'd say it's still enough. I've used them on a plane and the noise that did leak through was tolerable. Having to pop my ears was more annoying.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other.

First you say that it is not Russian people generally, but the **State of Russia** that you think should be ""punished."" 

Quickly you changed your position to say that you are okay if the ""average Russian suffers"" even though you blame ""one man."" 

>I understand most people around the world are only into their personal lives and ignores what goes on around them. This mentality is wrong in my opinion as it leads to states ignoring the will of the people.
