1) Punishment

2) Rehabilitation

She doesn't have to, but I believe that would be the more healthy thing to do for the relationship.

This sentiment supports the concept of your sex/gender being based on your external physical attributes. It ignores that your brain is very much a physical component of your body, and it's there in the brain that people are Male or Female or SomethingElse.

There is no ""becoming a woman"" or ""becoming a man"". There are only techniques people use to make their outward appearance align with their internal sense of self so they don't feel a jarring reaction every time someone says they are something they are not.

Spanking a kid doesn't tell a kid *why* not to engage in a behavior; it only teaches them to fear the consequences of the behavior, which might temporarily fix the problem, but if a parent takes the effort to make it clear to the kid why the behavior is wrong, model correct behavior, reward for good behavior, and discipline them properly only if it continues, then that will correct it in their head.

Well....that's not what I hear all the ladies saying, quite the opposite actually, and frequently too not just in isolated circumstances.

I'm not sure what sort of ""male activities"" we supposedly have that are male exclusive and require big muscles (today).  And I'm also not sure what a big dick would functionally help to accomplish in any activity in any time period (ever).  Take a 20 foot long piss like in the movie Iceman with Donnie Yen?

Im sure it wouldnt take me very long to find instances of this around the web. But ive heard it in person and around the web, in the media. And no, Im not just talking about porn. 

im not saying that women prefer huge dick. Im saying that most women would prefer 6inches compared to 4inches because it feels better. Saying otherwise is being nice/dishonest.

Noah is almost wholeheartedly for releasing the salaries, probably at least in part because Immortals is a new VC-backed company. For Noah, it's better this than nothing and it seems like nothing is the only alternative.

Bryce also clearly favors the publicized player salaries, but is approaching it from a practical/experienced look. The salary information is only a drop in the bucket of information that players really need to properly evaluate themselves.

Marty seems staunchly against the release of player salaries because he sees them as too skewed, non-contextual, and inflammatory for the value they might provide to the players who need the information.

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments.  The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass.

The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7.

I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.  The Momentums are really laid back up top, the the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.

Having to pop my ears was more annoying.

Noise isolation is passively blocking sound while cancellation plays an inverse sound wave compared to the outside noise it picks up with its mic. The two waves cancel each other.

d7t4ki6,"> According to Iaquinta, the UFC allowed him to bow out of the fighter summit but then when he posted photos on a beach near his house a few days later, he received a call asking why he was playing in the sand when he was supposed to be too sick to attend the meeting in Las Vegas.

Lol

> Iaquinta eventually got on a conference call with UFC officials to explain what had happened but the end result was still the same. He wasn't eligible for any post fight bonuses such as 'Performance of the Night' for his next three bouts in the UFC.

If the boot media isn't handy, or you want to give yourself a bit of an extra challenge, edit your grub prompt to boot to `init=/bin/bash`.

This has the effect of pretty much only requiring a working kernel, but also requires you to bring up anything you need (read-write access to your disks, any partitions other than /, networking) manually, yourself.

Of course it does. Fallen has won alot more because he played in a way better team meanwhile k0nfig has played in a team much worse and therefore lost alot more resulting in a lower rating.

oh please, k0nfig is much better as a pure entry. Fallens opening kill stats are better because he is an awper and awpers usually tends to have a higher opening kill stats.

The decision of Tokyo is a provocation in the eyes of Australia and New Zealand, outraged by the annual Japanese expeditions to Antarctica.
